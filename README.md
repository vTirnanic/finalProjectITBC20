# Final Project Overview

This is my final project for the Software Tester (QA) training program at the IT Bootcamp School in Belgrade, Serbia, 
conducted from August to October 2024.

The project involves both manual and automated testing of the e-commerce website saucedemo.com, along with comprehensive
bug reports detailing identified issues and their resolutions. Automated tests were developed in Java using the Selenium
framework for browser automation. All development was performed in the IntelliJ IDEA environment, a robust platform for 
Java development.

To enhance the testing process, the TestNG framework was employed, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern was 
implemented to improve the maintenance and readability of the tests. Additionally, the Apache POI library was utilized 
for Data-Driven Testing, allowing for more efficient management of test data and enabling the execution of tests with 
various input scenarios.
