This is my final project for the Software Tester (QA) training program at IT Bootcamp School in Belgrade, Serbia, conducted from August to October 2024.

The project involves both manual and automated testing of the e-commerce website saucedemo.com with comprehensive bug reports.

The automated tests were developed in Java, utilizing the Selenium framework to facilitate browser automation. All development was carried out in the IntelliJ IDEA environment, which provides a robust platform for Java development.

To enhance the testing process, we employed the TestNG testing framework, implementing the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to improve test maintenance and readability. Additionally, we utilized the Apache POI library to facilitate Data Driven Testing, enabling us to manage test data more efficiently and execute tests with varying input scenarios.
