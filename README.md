This is my final project for the Software Tester (QA) training program at the IT Bootcamp School in Belgrade, Serbia, conducted from August to October 2024. 

The project involves both manual and automated testing of the e-commerce website saucedemo.com, along with comprehensive bug reports. I developed automated tests in Java using the Selenium framework for browser automation. All development was performed in the IntelliJ IDEA environment, a robust platform for Java development.

To enhance the testing process, I employed the TestNG framework and implemented the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which improved the maintenance and readability of the tests. Additionally, I utilized the Apache POI library for Data-Driven Testing, allowing for more efficient management of test data and enabling the execution of tests with various input data.
